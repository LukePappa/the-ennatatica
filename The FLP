The very fact that you experience existence as a human being cannot be taken for granted or be reasonably justified as a coincidence or chance occurance.

The Fine Life Problem requires two presuppositions. The first is that something like panpsychism is true. The second is that the likelihood of existing as a human being corresponds to man’s prevalence amongst the set of all extant minds. Combining these two things together would mean that the probability of being human is virtually zero percent. This presents us with the FLP, which is why you find yourself in an exceptionally privileged mental state–namely as a human being–rather than as an infinitely more common and simpler sentience or proto-sentience.

The solutions to the problem fall into two camps. There are premise-denying solutions and premise-affirming solutions. Premise-denying solutions include the propositions that we live in a simulation or that humans have souls. These solve the FLP simply by avoiding it. Premise-affirming solutions are much harder to come up with. In general, they have to render your extraordinary existential circumstances ordinary, unprivileged, or otherwise expected. The typical premise affirming solution is that every mind is destined to experience a “highest state of being” within their respective timelines. Explanations of what that state of being looks like and how fate works vary.
