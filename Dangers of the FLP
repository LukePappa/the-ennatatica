Even if the solution to the FLP is correct, it would effectively be false to everyone in the universe except you, per the nature of timelines. Teaching the FLP, and by extention the solution to it, would be selling false hope. In addition to this, it would cause widespread wreckless behavior among those who think they're "invincible". Tradegy will invariably ensue. 

For these reasons I will not only keep the FLP to myself, but also watch for those who may discover it on their own and try to reason with them. This is the primary reason why I've put the FLP here, so I can prove I'm not some fraudster.
